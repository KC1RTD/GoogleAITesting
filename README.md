Google AI Testing

This is an initial test of Google's AI. Why did <br> I choose Google's AI? Well, the rest of them gave me so much grief with the API keys that I had to give up.

So, this pointless little piece of code will generate content based on what you put in the <br>
response = model.generate_content("hhhheeeellllooo") and give you back stuff.
<br>
Again, I have no idea what I am doing, so feel free to comment or give feeback.

1. Need a Python IDE - I use Pycham Pro
2. Need a Google AI API key - https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
3. Then go have fun with it. Thanks for reading!
